    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the <strong>Databases with Python: MySQL, SQLite & MongoDB</strong> course!
    </p>
    <p>
        In today's data-driven world, <strong>databases</strong> are the backbone of almost every application. 
        Whether you're managing user data for a web app, organizing files in a corporate system, or analyzing 
        massive datasets as a data scientist, understanding how to use and manipulate databases is an essential skill.
    </p>
    <p>
        This course is designed to help you master the art of working with databases using the Python programming 
        language. From structured relational databases like <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>SQLite</strong> to the 
        flexible and scalable world of <strong>NoSQL</strong> with <strong>MongoDB</strong>, you'll gain a 
        comprehensive understanding of modern database systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Databases Are Important</h2>
    <p>
        Databases are the cornerstone of any application. They enable developers to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Store and organize data</strong> efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>Query and manipulate data</strong> to provide dynamic functionalities.</li>
        <li>Handle <strong>large-scale information</strong> in a structured or unstructured format.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Proficiency in databases is not just a skill but a necessity in the tech industry. Skilled database 
        developers are in high demand, with competitive salaries and opportunities to work on cutting-edge projects.
    </p>
